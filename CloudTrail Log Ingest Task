Got it ‚Äî you basically need to build a CloudTrail LogGroup ingestion monitoring solution from scratch, but since you‚Äôve never done it before, we‚Äôll treat this like a step-by-step learning + delivery plan so you‚Äôre both learning the concepts and actually producing the deliverable.

Here‚Äôs a structured action plan:

Step 1 ‚Äî Understand the Business Goal
Purpose: The team wants to ensure that CloudTrail logs from a specific LogGroup are consistently ingested into Splunk.

Outcome:

A dashboard showing whether logs are arriving regularly.

Alerts when ingestion drops or stops.

Step 2 ‚Äî Learn the Data
Identify the source of logs:

Which AWS CloudTrail LogGroup is being monitored? (Name, region, etc.)

Confirm whether ingestion is via HTTP Event Collector (HEC), S3, or another method.

Check Splunk index:

Likely index=cloud-aws, but confirm exact index and sourcetype(s).

Run a sample search to verify data presence:

spl
Copy
Edit
index=cloud-aws sourcetype=aws:cloudtrail
| stats count by _time, source
| sort - _time
This helps confirm ingestion and field availability.

Step 3 ‚Äî Understand the Sample Query
The example you were given:

spl
Copy
Edit
stats values(POR) as POUR 
where index=cloud-aws host=splunk-httpinput.health.mil 
by source sourcetype 
myexpand POR
POR here might mean Point of Receipt or Proof of Receipt (likely a custom field from the ingest heartbeat).

You‚Äôll need to:

Replace it with a meaningful metric (like _time or count of events).

Understand if myexpand is a macro ‚Äî check Settings ‚Üí Advanced Search ‚Üí Search Macros for myexpand.

Step 4 ‚Äî Build the Dashboard
Pick KPIs for ingestion health:

Events per minute/hour for each LogGroup.

Last event time vs current time (to detect delays).

Example KPI search:

spl
Copy
Edit
index=cloud-aws sourcetype=aws:cloudtrail
| stats latest(_time) as last_seen, count as event_count by source
| eval age_in_minutes = round((now() - last_seen)/60, 2)
| eval status = if(age_in_minutes > 5, "Delayed", "OK")
Visualization:

Table with source, event_count, status.

Timechart of events over the past 24h.

Step 5 ‚Äî Review & Avoid Redundancy
Share dashboard with VVP (whoever that is in your org) to check if:

There‚Äôs already an existing ingestion health panel for CloudTrail.

You‚Äôre not duplicating something already in ITSI or Monitoring Console.

Step 6 ‚Äî Create Alerts from Dashboard Queries
Once approved:

Save key searches as alerts.

Trigger conditions:

No data for >5 minutes.

Error rate > threshold.

Send email to Kevin Butters and Avery D (verify correct addresses).

Set severity based on impact.

Step 7 ‚Äî Integrate with ITSI
Map these KPIs into MMA Splunk Enterprise Data Availability service.

Use ITSI‚Äôs entity & KPI model:

Service: CloudTrail_Ingest

KPI 1: Event count per logGroup

KPI 2: Last event age

Configure episodes so ingestion issues appear in your ITSI glass table.

Step 8 ‚Äî Document Your Process
While doing each step, keep short notes on:

Data sources.

Queries.

Dashboard panels.

Alert thresholds.

This will help you both learn and hand off the solution later.



##################################################################################

Understand the Task and Requirements
Goal: Create a dashboard in Splunk to monitor CloudTrail log ingestion per LogGroup and verify consistent log flow.

Audience: VVP for review ‚Üí Kevin Butters and Avery D will get alerts after approval.

Detection logic: Will likely be a stats or timechart query grouped by LogGroup (source or sourcetype).

Dependencies: You‚Äôll need access to:

The index where CloudTrail logs live (index=cloud-aws in the example).

A field that represents the LogGroup (often in source or logGroupName).

A timestamp field (_time).

2Ô∏è‚É£ Learn the Data
Since you‚Äôve never done it before, first explore what the data looks like:

spl
Copy
Edit
index=cloud-aws sourcetype=aws:cloudtrail* 
| head 20
Check:

Which field identifies the LogGroup (might be source, logGroupName, or extracted from _raw).

Whether POR or POUR exists in your events.

Time ranges ‚Äî make sure data is fresh and continuous.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Build the Base Query
Use the example query provided and adapt to your data:

spl
Copy
Edit
index=cloud-aws host=splunk-httpinput.health.mil
| stats values(POR) as POUR by source sourcetype
But for ingest heartbeat per LogGroup, you‚Äôll want something like:

spl
Copy
Edit
index=cloud-aws host=splunk-httpinput.health.mil
| timechart count by source span=1h
span=1h ‚Üí lets you check hourly ingestion.

Replace source with your actual LogGroup field.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Detect Missing or Irregular Data
You want to know when logs are not coming in consistently:

spl
Copy
Edit
index=cloud-aws host=splunk-httpinput.health.mil
| timechart count by source span=1h
| foreach * [ eval <<FIELD>>_status=if(<<FIELD>>=0,"MISSING","OK") ]
This creates a status per LogGroup. If missing, you can flag it.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Build the Dashboard
Create a single dashboard with:

Panel 1: Hourly ingest counts by LogGroup (line chart).

Panel 2: Table view showing ‚ÄúOK‚Äù vs ‚ÄúMISSING‚Äù per LogGroup for the last 24 hours.

Panel 3: Any trend or comparison over the last 7 days.

Use color coding (green for OK, red for missing).

6Ô∏è‚É£ Review for Redundancy
Once dashboard is built, export screenshots or share the dashboard link.

Ask VVP: ‚ÄúDoes this already exist in another dashboard?‚Äù

Adjust if needed to remove overlap.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Create Alerts from Dashboard Queries
After approval:

Convert your ‚ÄúMISSING‚Äù status panel into a search that runs every hour:

spl
Copy
Edit
index=cloud-aws host=splunk-httpinput.health.mil earliest=-1h@h latest=@h
| stats count by source
| where count=0
Send alerts to Kevin Butters and Avery D (email or Slack/Teams, depending on setup).

8Ô∏è‚É£ Document Your Work
Write a short guide:

What fields and queries you used.

How to read the dashboard.

How the alerts are triggered.

9Ô∏è‚É£ Test the Alerts
Simulate missing logs by searching an old time range.

Confirm Kevin and Avery receive alerts.

üîü Handover
Share the dashboard link, alert settings, and documentation with your team.

Mark the task complete in your ticketing system.

###########################################################################################################################

ere‚Äôs a step-by-step plan you can follow to tackle this CloudTrail log ingest dashboard and alert task, even if you‚Äôve never done it before:

Step 1 ‚Äì Understand the Goal
Purpose: Ensure CloudTrail logs for a specific logGroup are being received consistently in Splunk.

Deliverables:

A dashboard showing CloudTrail ingest heartbeat per logGroup.

Alerts that trigger when logs are missing or delayed.

Review by VVP to confirm no redundancy with existing monitoring.

Step 2 ‚Äì Learn the Data
Check data availability:

Run a basic search:

spl
Copy
Edit
index=cloud-aws sourcetype="aws:cloudtrail" 
| stats count by logGroup, _time
Verify which fields (logGroup, source, sourcetype, POR) are present.

Understand POR (mentioned in detection logic):

Find out from your team what POR represents ‚Äî it might be a processing timestamp or point of receipt.

Run:

spl
Copy
Edit
index=cloud-aws host=splunk-httpinput.health.mil 
| table _time, source, sourcetype, logGroup, POR
This will help confirm what you can use for heartbeat checks.

Step 3 ‚Äì Build the Dashboard Query
Start from the provided query:

spl
Copy
Edit
index=cloud-aws host=splunk-httpinput.health.mil
| stats values(POR) as POUR by source sourcetype
Modify to group by logGroup and time:

spl
Copy
Edit
index=cloud-aws host=splunk-httpinput.health.mil
| timechart span=1h count as event_count by logGroup
This will let you see ingestion gaps visually.

Step 4 ‚Äì Add Consistency Check
To detect gaps:

spl
Copy
Edit
index=cloud-aws host=splunk-httpinput.health.mil
| bin _time span=1h
| stats count as event_count by _time, logGroup
| eval status=if(event_count==0, "Missing Logs", "OK")
This can be turned into a panel that highlights problem logGroups.

Step 5 ‚Äì Build the Dashboard
Create two main panels:

Heartbeat Chart ‚Äì Timechart showing event_count by logGroup.

Missing Log Table ‚Äì Table listing logGroups with zero events for a time period.

Step 6 ‚Äì Review for Redundancy
Share the dashboard with VVP.

Ask if similar ingestion dashboards already exist in ITSI or Cloud Monitoring.

If redundancy exists, merge logic or enhance instead of duplicating.

Step 7 ‚Äì Create Alerts
From the missing log query:

Set alert trigger: when status="Missing Logs" for >1 interval.

Send to: Kevin Butters & Avery D.

Use cron scheduling to run every 15‚Äì60 minutes.

Step 8 ‚Äì Tie into ITSI (MMA Data Availability)
Check if MMA ITSI service KPIs already track ingest.

If yes, add the logGroup heartbeat as a KPI.

If no, create a new ITSI KPI from your search, with thresholds for ‚ÄúWarning‚Äù and ‚ÄúCritical‚Äù missing log counts.

Step 9 ‚Äì Document the Setup
Include:

Dashboard name, owner, location.

Search queries used.

Alert conditions & recipients.

Any dependencies or limitations.

Step 10 ‚Äì Test End-to-End
Simulate missing logs (if possible) or find a time when logs stopped.

Ensure dashboard highlights it & alert fires correctly.
###########################################################################################################################
Got it ‚Äî here‚Äôs a clear step-by-step plan you can follow for this CloudTrail Log Ingest dashboard and alert setup task, assuming it‚Äôs your first time working on it:

Step 1 ‚Äì Understand the Requirements
Goal: Create a dashboard to confirm that CloudTrail logs for a given LogGroup are being ingested consistently.

Outputs:

Dashboard showing log ingestion heartbeat by LogGroup.

Review with VVP for redundancy.

Alerts to Kevin Butters & Avery D based on dashboard queries.

Data Source: AWS CloudTrail logs in Splunk (index=cloud-aws).

Step 2 ‚Äì Familiarize Yourself with the Data
Run exploratory searches:

spl
Copy
Edit
index=cloud-aws sourcetype=*cloudtrail* 
| stats count by logGroupName, _time
Confirm field names: Is it logGroupName, source, or something custom?

Verify time granularity and ingestion frequency (e.g., every few minutes? hourly? daily?).

Check that host=splunk-httpinput.health.mil actually appears in the logs ‚Äî confirm it‚Äôs not just example text.

Step 3 ‚Äì Define ‚ÄúConsistent‚Äù Ingestion
Work with stakeholders to define:

Expected frequency (e.g., new logs every 5 min, every hour, etc.).

Threshold for missing logs (e.g., alert if no logs for > 30 minutes).

This definition will guide the dashboard visualizations and alert logic.

Step 4 ‚Äì Build the Base Search
From the sample query in your notes:

spl
Copy
Edit
index=cloud-aws host=splunk-httpinput.health.mil 
| stats values(POR) as POUR by source sourcetype 
But modify for your use case:

spl
Copy
Edit
index=cloud-aws host=splunk-httpinput.health.mil 
| timechart count BY logGroupName span=5m
This shows ingestion counts for each LogGroup in 5-minute buckets.

Look for gaps (zero counts).

Step 5 ‚Äì Create the Dashboard
Panels to include:

Ingestion Over Time: Timechart per logGroupName.

Heartbeat Status: Latest event per log group with time since last event.

Missing Data Alerts (visual): Highlight log groups with > X minutes since last ingest.

Use table panels to show last event time, time since last, and status (Healthy / Stale).

Step 6 ‚Äì Review with VVP
Export or share the dashboard.

Ask: ‚ÄúDo we already have something similar? Any panels redundant?‚Äù

Adjust according to their feedback.

Step 7 ‚Äì Create Alerts
Once approved:

Base search for alert:

spl
Copy
Edit
index=cloud-aws host=splunk-httpinput.health.mil 
| stats latest(_time) as last_ingest by logGroupName 
| eval minutes_since=round((now()-last_ingest)/60,0) 
| where minutes_since > 30
Alert Settings:

Trigger: When results > 0.

Send email to: Kevin Butters, Avery D.

Subject: "CloudTrail LogGroup Ingest Delay Detected".

Frequency: Once every 30 minutes or 1 hour.

Step 8 ‚Äì Document the Process
Include:

Data sources

Dashboard panels

Alert logic & thresholds

Owners & recipients

Save this as part of your MMA Splunk Enterprise Data Availability documentation.

Step 9 ‚Äì Test Everything
Simulate a missing log scenario by filtering test data.

Make sure the alert fires and emails are received.


##############################################################################################
Questions
1. Requirements & Scope

Can you clarify what ‚Äúheartbeat‚Äù means for this use case‚Äîare we looking for any CloudTrail events per logGroup within a time window, or a specific event type?

What is the acceptable ‚Äúno data‚Äù threshold before it‚Äôs considered a failure? (e.g., 5 min, 15 min, 1 hour)

Are we monitoring all CloudTrail logGroups or only a specific subset? If a subset, can you provide the list?

2. Dashboard Structure & Metrics

What key fields or metrics should the dashboard show besides ingestion status (e.g., volume, last event time, source count)?

Should the dashboard display historical trends or only current status?

Are there any specific visual formats you prefer (e.g., timechart, table, single-value panel)?

3. Alerts & Notifications

How often should the alert check for missed data (e.g., every 5 min, every hour)?

Should the alert reset automatically when data resumes, or require manual acknowledgment?

Should Kevin Butters and Avery D be notified only on failures, or also on recoveries?

Is email the only notification method, or do you want Splunk alert actions to include other channels (e.g., Slack, ServiceNow)?

4. Detection Logic & Query Details

Can you confirm the sample query provided is the baseline or is it already validated?

What exactly does POR and POUR represent in this query, and do we have documentation for those fields?

Should the tstats search span a specific time range (e.g., last 24 hours, last 60 minutes) for detection?

Do we need to enrich the results with logGroup names, AWS account IDs, or regions?

5. ITSI Integration

How should this tie into the ‚ÄúMMA Splunk Enterprise Data Availability‚Äù service‚Äîshould it be a new KPI or enhance an existing one?

What thresholds and severity levels should be configured in ITSI for this KPI?

######################################################################################
Answers:
Start with 1 hour failure.

Monitor these sourcetypes, aws:elb:accesslogs, aws:audit:logs, aws:cloudtrail, aws:route53 by POR


Dashboard can be simple, as it is just need to validate the methodolgy before moving to an alert. Some way of knowing the historical trend may be help, so a sparkline for a day if it searches quickly.


Alert can check hourly. Automatic reset. Notifications to me and Paul until we are confident it doesn't generate false positive. Kevin and Avery will need to be trained on it as well.


Tstats for 60 minutes is good for alerts.
No enrichment is needed. Events should include all that is needed.


This can be integrated into ITSI in whichever way you think is best.  We would need to have a discussion on thresholds and severity and what the results would be.

####################################################################################################
Proposed Solution
Here‚Äôs a proposed solution to the ‚ÄúCloudTrail Ingest Heartbeat by LogGroup‚Äù task using the answers you provided, with integration into ITSI and an initial 1-hour failure detection threshold.
. Detection Logic
We‚Äôll use a tstats search to check ingestion for the key AWS sourcetypes:

aws:elb:accesslogs

aws:audit:logs

aws:cloudtrail

aws:route53

Example detection search (for last 60 minutes):

| tstats count as event_count 
    where index=cloud-aws sourcetype IN ("aws:elb:accesslogs", "aws:audit:logs", "aws:cloudtrail", "aws:route53") 
    by sourcetype host 
| eval time_checked=strftime(now(), "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
| eval status=if(event_count>0, "OK", "No Data")


This checks for data every hour per sourcetype/host.

If event_count = 0 for a sourcetype in that period, it‚Äôs a failure.


2. Dashboard Design
Purpose: Validate methodology before turning into alerts.

Panels:

Panel 1 ‚Äì Current Status Table: sourcetype, host, event count in last 60 min, status (OK/No Data).

Panel 2 ‚Äì Historical Trend: Sparkline of event count over the last 24 hours for each sourcetype (using timechart).

spl
| tstats count where index=cloud-aws sourcetype IN ("aws:elb:accesslogs", "aws:audit:logs", "aws:cloudtrail", "aws:route53") 
  by _time sourcetype span=1h
| timechart span=1h sum(count) as events by sourcetype


Keep dashboard lightweight for quick loading.

Include filtering by sourcetype & host for ad-hoc checks.

3. Alert Configuration
Name: Cloud AWS LogGroup Ingest Failure (Hourly)

Schedule: Every 60 minutes

Trigger Condition: status = "No Data" for any monitored sourcetype

Reset: Automatic on next successful ingest (no manual reset needed)

Notifications:

Initial testing phase: Send to you & Paul only.

After validation: Expand to Kevin Butters & Avery D (with training on interpretation).



4. ITSI Integration
Create a Service: MMA - AWS Cloud Logs Ingestion

Add KPIs for each sourcetype using the tstats logic above.

Thresholds:

Critical (red): event_count = 0 in last 60 min

Normal (green): event_count > 0

Severity mapping:

Critical = KPI 0 (no ingest)

Normal = KPI 100 (ingest present)

Use KPI-based Episode Alerts to aggregate failures across sourcetypes into a single incident.


Approval & Redundancy Check
Share dashboard with VVP for review to confirm:

No duplicate coverage with existing monitoring.

Query efficiency & quick load time.

Once approved, migrate KPI searches to ITSI and enable alerting.

###################################################################################################
I can now draft the exact Splunk dashboard JSON with the tstats queries, sparkline trends, and filtering so you can import it directly. That way, you‚Äôll have the ‚Äúvalidation‚Äù dashboard ready before alerting is turned on.

Here‚Äôs the proposed solution for your task based on the answers you provided:

1. Objective
Create a Splunk search, dashboard, and alert to monitor for 1-hour failures across specific AWS sourcetypes (aws:elb:accesslogs, aws:audit:logs, aws:cloudtrail, aws:route53) filtered by POR.

2. Search Query (Tstats for performance)
spl
Copy
Edit
| tstats count as event_count 
  where index=* 
    (sourcetype=aws:elb:accesslogs OR sourcetype=aws:audit:logs OR sourcetype=aws:cloudtrail OR sourcetype=aws:route53) 
    POR=* 
  by _time, sourcetype span=60m
| eval status=if(event_count==0,"FAILURE","OK")
| table _time sourcetype event_count status
Notes:

span=60m checks counts per hour.

POR=* assumes POR is a field in the data ‚Äî adjust to your exact field name.

status determines whether it‚Äôs a failure or not based on zero events.

3. Dashboard
Panel 1:

Type: Timechart with sparkline for daily trend.

Purpose: Quickly visualize if there have been drops to zero events over time.

Example Search for Sparkline:

spl
Copy
Edit
| tstats count as event_count 
  where index=* (sourcetype=aws:elb:accesslogs OR sourcetype=aws:audit:logs OR sourcetype=aws:cloudtrail OR sourcetype=aws:route53) POR=* 
  by _time span=1h 
| timechart span=1h sum(event_count) as total
| eval trend=sparkline(total)
4. Alert
Type: Scheduled Search

Run Every: Hour

Condition: status="FAILURE"

Reset: Automatic reset after next successful run.

Recipients: You + Paul (during testing)

Future: Add Kevin & Avery after validation.

Search for Alert Condition:

spl
Copy
Edit
| tstats count as event_count 
  where index=* (sourcetype=aws:elb:accesslogs OR sourcetype=aws:audit:logs OR sourcetype=aws:cloudtrail OR sourcetype=aws:route53) POR=* 
  by _time span=60m 
| where event_count=0
5. ITSI Integration
Create a KPI in ITSI using the same Tstats search.

KPI Thresholds & Severity to be defined in follow-up meeting.

Example:

Critical: event_count=0

Normal: event_count>0

‚úÖ End Result:

Hourly failure detection.

Dashboard with historical trends via sparklines.

Alert with phased notification rollout.

ITSI KPI ready for integration after threshold agreement.

If you want, I can now prepare the exact XML/JSON panel code so you can drop this straight into a Splunk dashboard without manual setup. That way you can validate the methodology right away.
