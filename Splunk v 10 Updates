Certainly! Here's a structured approach to presenting the new features of Splunk version 10, focusing on the key points you've mentioned:

1. Introduction to the New Search Sequence in Splunk 10
Explain the change: In Splunk 10, field filters are now processed first in the sequence of search-time operations.
Previous behavior: Previously, field filters were processed fourth in the sequence.
Implication: This change impacts how downstream operations (like data transformations or visualizations) work, because filtering occurs earlier, possibly affecting data availability later in the process.
2. Understanding the Impact of Field Filters Moving First
Downstream operations: Because filters are applied earlier, any operations that depend on specific field values (like calculations, joins, or visualizations) might break or produce unexpected results if the expected data is filtered out prematurely.
Reference: Mention the official documentation—"The sequence of search-time operations in the Splunk Platform Manual"— for detailed insights.
3. Considerations for Organizations Using CIM
Role of CIM: The Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) standardizes fields across data sources.
Impact on sensitive fields: When applying field filters in environments using CIM, be aware of impact on:
Data model acceleration (DMA)
Data integrity and search performance
Best practice: Understand how field filtering might affect data models and performance optimization strategies, especially when working with sensitive data.
4. Steps to Approach and Answer These Questions
A. Prepare your presentation content:
Explain the change: Use diagrams or flowcharts illustrating before and after search sequences.
Discuss implications: Provide examples of how early filtering could affect common use cases.
Highlight best practices:
Carefully plan where to apply field filters.
Test search queries after upgrades.
Monitor data model performance post-filtering.
B. Practical demonstration:
Show example SPL (Search Processing Language) queries demonstrating:
Filtering prior to other operations.
Possible issues with downstream operations.
Discuss data model impact and ways to mitigate these issues.
C. Use real-world scenarios:
Scenario 1: Filtering sensitive data early to improve performance.
Scenario 2: Filtering that inadvertently removes data required for subsequent calculations.
D. Reference official documentation:
"The sequence of search-time operations" in Splunk documentation.
"Plan for field filters" in the security and data model manuals.
5. Summary and Recommendations
Emphasize reviewing existing searches after upgrading.
Advocate for testing in a controlled environment before deploying changes broadly.
Encourage collaboration with data model and security teams to optimize use of field filters without compromising data integrity.

provide spl sample live so we can see it in action with our data.If you wabnt to include search time order operation that would probably help explain the change.Think of it as a train trainer

DA
Certainly! Here's a detailed example with sample SPL (Search Processing Language) to demonstrate the change, including a visualization of the search-time operation sequence. This will help your audience understand how field filters are now processed first, and the impact on downstream operations.

SPL Example Demonstrating the Search Sequence Change
Scenario:
Suppose you have data containing fields like source, user, and status. You want to filter on status="error" and then perform further calculations.

Traditional (Pre-Splunk 10):
splunk
Copy
index=main
| search status="error"
| stats count by user
| where count > 10
Updated (Splunk 10+):
Field filter (search status="error") is now processed first, before other operations, including the stats and where.
Live SPL Demo (Simulated)
Step 1: Basic data and structure
Let's assume the data looks like:

source	user	status
syslog	alice	error
syslog	bob	ok
syslog	alice	error
syslog	charlie	error
syslog	bob	error
Step 2: Search with filter applied first
splunk
Copy
index=main source=syslog status="error"
| stats count by user
| where count > 1
What happens?
Filtering (status="error") is now done first.
Then, stats count by user counts the errors per user.
Finally, where count > 1 filters users with more than 1 error.
Expected Output:
user	count
alice	2
bob	1 (filtered out, since 1 not > 1)
charlie	1 (filtered out)
Only alice remains because she has more than 1 error.
Visualize Search-Time Operations (Train Analogy)
Train operation order in previous versions:

Data retrieval
Filtering (status="error")
Aggregation (stats)
Final filtering (where)
Train operation order now:

Data retrieval
Filtering (status="error") ← (processed first)
Aggregation (stats)
Final filtering (where) ← (after aggregation, but still downstream)
Key Takeaways for Your Presentation:
In the new order, field filtering occurs before aggregations.
If downstream filters depend on prior field filtering, their results could change.
Always test existing queries after upgrade to ensure correctness.
Next Step: Try It Out in Your Environment
Run the above SPL queries in your Splunk instance.
Observe how filtering on status="error" acts differently or similarly to previous versions.
Adjust your search strategy accordingly.
